* Usage
** To print RGB for all Wallust themes
~wallust-theme-previews all~
** To print RGB for single Wallust theme
~wallust-theme-previews <theme-name>~
- Note, theme name must be as it appears in ~wallust theme list~
  
* TODO
+ There is still some stdout from ~wallust~ that I would like to remove for easier parsing
+ There is a bug in ~wallust-theme-previews all~ where it isn't excluding the word "Extra:" in ~wallust theme list~ stdout
